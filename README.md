# Spring in Action 5 Samples

Taco Cloud is a Spring Boot application based on the book Spring in Action, Fifth Edition, by Craig
Walls and the [habuma's repository](https://github.com/habuma/spring-in-action-5-samples).
A separate project was created for each chapter of the book.

## Lombok Plugin

Starting with the second chapter, projects use the lombok library to eliminate boilerplate code.
If using an IDE, you need to install a plugin to enable lombok support.
