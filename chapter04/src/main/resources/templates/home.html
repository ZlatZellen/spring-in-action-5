                        We love tacos. All kinds of tacos. And we love being creative with the way we make our tacos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some taco joints offer a set, finite menu of tacos to choose from. At Taco Cloud, we want to share
                        the joy of taco creativity with you, allowing you to design your own tacos from a palette of fresh
                        and delicious ingredients. While we may offer some of our creations for you to try, the real fun
                        is when you create your own tortilla-wrapped works of art.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And, even though we love tacos and creativity, we prefer to avoid doing complex math. That's why
                        all tacos are priced modestly at $4.99 each, no matter how many or what ingredients you choose.
